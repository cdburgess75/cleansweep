## What is CleanSweep?

Dave's CleanSweep is a fully automated, silent PowerShell remediation tool built for MSP/RMM deployment. It scans and cleans Windows endpoints across 22 phases — removing PUPs, browser hijackers, adware, malware persistence mechanisms, and collecting actionable intelligence — all without any user interaction or pop-ups.

Designed for real-world MSP use: tested across Windows 10, Windows 11, Windows Server 2012 R2 through 2022, PowerShell 4.0+.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **22-phase remediation pipeline** — process termination through event log IOC analysis
- **Live threat intelligence** — downloads Neo23x0 signature-base IOCs on every run (hash, filename, C2)
- **Dynamic IOC matching** — 3,800+ filename patterns compiled into memory-safe chunked regex
- **Professional reporting** — machine info, removed items, IOC alerts, recently installed software, metrics summary
- **Verdict banners** — `Clean Sweep!` or `Dave is Sweeping!` at the bottom so you know instantly
- **RMM-native** — fully headless, no user interaction, exit codes 0/1/2 for automation
- **Server-aware** — skips workstation-only operations on Server OS, handles PS 4.0 compatibility

## 📋 Requirements

- **OS:** Windows 7 SP1 / Server 2008 R2 or newer
- **PowerShell:** 3.0+ (5.1 recommended)
- **Privileges:** Administrator (required)
- **Network:** Optional — downloads live IOC intel on each run, falls back to disk cache or hardcoded patterns if offline

---

## 🚀 Usage

### Direct execution
```powershell
.\cleansweep.ps1
```

### RMM / Datto / CentraStage deployment
Deploy as a script component with administrator context. No parameters required. Fully silent.

### Exit codes
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Clean — nothing detected |
| `1` | Completed with errors |
| `2` | IOC alerts present — analyst review recommended |

---

## 📁 Output

| Path | Contents |
|------|----------|
| `C:\ProgramData\Logs\DavesCleanSweep\` | Run logs (`DavesCleanSweep_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.log`) |
| `C:\ProgramData\Logs\DavesCleanSweep\Intel\` | Cached IOC lists from Neo23x0 |

---

## 📧 Email Reporting (Optional)

CleanSweep can send an HTML report with the full log attached after every run. Configure SMTP in the `$Script:Config` block at the top of the script:

```powershell
SmtpServer  = 'smtp.office365.com'
SmtpPort    = 587
SmtpUseTLS  = $true
SmtpFrom    = 'cleansweep@yourdomain.com'
SmtpTo      = 'you@yourdomain.com'
SmtpUser    = 'cleansweep@yourdomain.com'
SmtpPass    = 'your-app-password'
```

> **Note:** Office 365 requires SMTP AUTH enabled on the sending mailbox.  
> Microsoft 365 Admin Center → Users → Active Users → [user] → Mail → Manage email apps → Authenticated SMTP ✓

## 🚧 Roadmap

- [ ] Before/After executive summary in report
- [ ] HTML email report with professional layout
- [ ] Detection scoring system (0–100 risk score per machine)
- [ ] Config-driven cleanup profiles (workstation / server / kiosk)
- [ ] Integration hooks (EDR / SIEM structured JSON output)
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI for syntax validation

---

## ⚠️ Safety Notice

CleanSweep performs system-level modifications including registry changes, scheduled task removal, service removal, and file system cleanup. Conservative matching is used for all destructive operations to minimize false positives.

**Always test in a controlled environment before broad deployment.**

Recycle Bin is never touched. User data is never removed. All destructive actions are logged.
