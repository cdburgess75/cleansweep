    ==============================================================================
    PHASE OVERVIEW v0.76
    ==============================================================================

    Phase  0  -  Hardware & OS Detection
               Collects OS version, RAM, CPU, disk, PS version. Sets capability
               flags used by downstream phases. Runs before any downloads so
               machine profile is available for Phase 1 decisions.

    Phase  1  -  Dynamic Intelligence Download
               Downloads hash IOC list, filename IOC list, and C2/hosts IOC list
               from Neo23x0/signature-base with 10-second timeout per request.
               On timeout or failure, falls back to local disk cache. If no cache
               exists, falls back to hardcoded lists. Zero user interaction.

    Phase  2  -  Machine Information Block
               Logs hostname, OS, build, last boot, uptime, domain/workgroup,
               logged-in user, Defender status, disk space. Moved earlier so
               machine context is available for ticket reference immediately.

    Phase  3  -  Process Termination
               Kills running processes matching known PUP/adware names.
               Dynamic filename IOC list from Phase 1 supplements hardcoded targets.

    Phase  4  -  Filesystem Artifact Cleanup
               Removes known PUP install directories. Conservative hardcoded list
               only due to false-positive risk on directory removal.

    Phase  5  -  Browser Extension Artifact Removal
               Removes hijacker extensions from Chrome, Edge, Firefox by known
               extension ID and manifest.json content match.

    Phase  6  -  Registry Uninstall
               Executes uninstallers from HKLM and HKCU uninstall hives.
               Conservative hardcoded matching  -  high false-positive risk.

    Phase  7  -  Service Removal
               Conservative hardcoded list only due to false-positive risk on
               service deletion. CIM-native, no sc.exe.

    Phase  8  -  Scheduled Task Removal
               Conservative hardcoded list only due to false-positive risk.
               IOC flagging retained for suspicious task names/paths.

    Phase  9  -  Run Key + RunOnce Persistence Cleanup
               Conservative hardcoded matching. IOC flagging for suspicious paths.

    Phase 10  -  Startup Folder LNK Cleanup
               Conservative hardcoded matching. IOC flagging for suspicious targets.

    Phase 11  -  Browser Policy Key Cleanup
               Dynamic patterns from Phase 1 supplement hardcoded targets.
               Low false-positive risk  -  cleans hijacker-controlled policy keys.

    Phase 12  -  Defender Exclusion Cleanup
               Dynamic patterns from Phase 1 supplement hardcoded targets.

    Phase 13  -  Hosts File Inspection
               Dynamic C2 IOC list from Phase 1. Internal IP ranges (127.x,
               192.168.x, 10.x, 172.16-31.x) explicitly protected from removal.

    Phase 14  -  WMI Persistence Audit
               Dynamic signatures from Phase 1 supplement hardcoded whitelist.

    Phase 15  -  Trojan / Malware IOC Detection
               Dynamic filename IOC list from Phase 1 supplements hardcoded
               29-family RAT/stealer signature set.

    Phase 16  -  Reboot Requirement Check
               Checks PendingFileRenameOperations and three additional indicators.
               If reboot required, logs a warning and sets the reboot flag for
               reporting. No automatic reboot  -  operator must reboot manually.

    Phase 17  -  MalwareBazaar Hash Lookup + Neo23x0 Fallback + Defender Fallback
               SHA256-hashes IOC executables. Queries MalwareBazaar with 10-second
               timeout. Falls back to local Neo23x0 hash IOC list if API
               unavailable. Falls back to Defender custom scan if not in either.

    Phase 18  -  Disk Space Cleanup (Safe Mode)
               Cleans Temp, WER, CBS, Prefetch, Windows Update cache, Delivery
               Optimization, IIS logs (>30d), Minidumps, Thumbnail cache.
               Windows.old removed via DISM if older than 30 days.
               RECYCLE BIN SKIPPED  -  too risky for automated MSP deployment.
               Reports file count and MB freed per location before and after.

    Phase 19  -  Recently Installed Software Report
               Lists software installed in last 30 days. No removals.

    Phase 20  -  Temp File Age Report
               Snapshots count/size/oldest file per Temp folder. Flags machines
               with files older than 1 year. Informational only.

    Phase 21  -  Event Log IOC Check
               Scans Security log (4688) and System log (7045). Dynamic IOC
               patterns from Phase 1 supplement hardcoded signatures.

    ==============================================================================

            Dell Command Power Manager added to WMI whitelist:
            DellCommandPowerManagerPolicyChangeEventFilter and
            DellCommandPowerManagerPolicyChangeEventConsumer suppressed.
            MalwareBazaar: hash_not_found treated as no_results, not
            unexpected response.
            Phase 3: OneBrowser process killed before Phase 4 cleanup.
            Phase 18: BITS/DoSvc stop/start wrapped with

            MalwareBazaar: added Auth-Key header support, $SK_MalwareBazaar_Enabled
            and $SK_MalwareBazaar_ApiKey config variables. Hash lookups now
            fully authenticated and functional.

            Added broad Datto fallback scan by DisplayName.
            Fixed JSON save line firing after log closed  -  now uses
            Write-Host directly.
            Fixed v1.0 changelog note  -  was a naming error, actual
            build was v0.68.
            Version : v0.69 -> v0.70 per versioning rule.

    v0.69 - Top-of-file config section: all configurables ($SK_Email_*,
            $SK_Syslog_*, $SK_Mode) with enable/disable toggles. Email
            wired to $SK_Email_Enabled. Syslog wired to $SK_Syslog_Enabled.
            Syslog output: sends structured RFC3164 syslog after each run
            via UDP or TCP. Skipped silently if server blank or disabled.
            JSON output moved to C:\ProgramData\ShellKnight\JSON\
            PUA/PUP target expansion: OneBrowser, OneWebSearch, Awesomehp,

            Services, and Tasks.
            Before/After executive summary added to console report.
            Fixed 0x%1!x! formatting artifact in Defender error message.
            Version : v0.68 -> v0.69 per versioning rule.

    v0.68 - Fixed StrictMode scoping: all Phase 2 variables ($freeGB, $uptime,
            $avProduct, $osEolWarn, $pcAgeWarn, $wuLastWarn, $bitlockerWarn,
            $defStatus, $inactiveAccounts etc) now initialized to safe defaults
            before Phase 2 try block so grading never throws if Phase 2 fails.
            Fixed $Script:HWInfo.RAM -> $Script:HWInfo.TotalRAMMB in perf score.
            Removed duplicate email disabled comment block.
            Enhanced AV detection: 3-layer approach  -  SecurityCenter2 (Layer 1),
            known MSP/enterprise service scan covering Datto AV, Webroot,
            Malwarebytes, Huntress, SentinelOne, CrowdStrike, Cylance, ESET,
            Sophos, Kaspersky, Carbon Black, Trend Micro (Layer 2), process
            scan fallback (Layer 3). Datto AV now detected correctly.
            Version : v0.67 -> v0.68 per versioning rule.

    v1.0  - [NAMING ERROR - actual build was v0.68] PROJECT RENAMED: Dave's CleanSweep -> ShellKnight.
            Log path: C:\ProgramData\ShellKnight\Logs\
            Log prefix: ShellKnight_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM.log
            Phase 2 expanded into full health assessment:
              - PC age from BIOS date (flag if over 5 years)
              - OS End of Life check with hardcoded EOL dates
              - BitLocker status detection
              - Windows Update last install date (flag if over 30 days)
              - AV/Defender detection via SecurityCenter2
              - Uptime warning if over 30 days
              - Last 3 interactive logons from event log 4624
            Inactive local account report (90+ days, report only).
            Security Grade (A-F) scoring system.
            Performance Grade (A-F) scoring system.
            JSON report output saved alongside log file.
            Granicus hosts whitelist (government platform).
            Windows Update Cache: stop BITS + UsoSvc + wuauserv.
            Version : v0.66 -> v0.68 (ShellKnight release).

    v0.66 - Phase 21: skip 4688 event scan on Server OS (too noisy/slow).
            Reduced MaxEvents from 5000 to 500 on workstations.
            Phase 15: whitelisted known Citrix installer filenames in
            drop locations (CitrixReceiver.exe, ReceiverCleanupUtility-New.exe
            and variants)  -  no longer flagged as IOCs.
            MalwareBazaar 401: demoted from WARN to INFO  -  expected
            behaviour without API key, not an error.
            Phase 18 wuauserv: added 30-second wait loop for service to
            fully stop before cleaning SoftwareDistribution\Download.
            Version : v0.65 -> v0.66 per versioning rule.

    v0.65 - Fixed Write-Log operator precedence bug: '-not $x -eq $null'
            always evaluated to $false, meaning NOTHING was ever written to
            the log file. Fixed to '($x -ne $null)'. This also explains why
            IOC report section always showed (none)  -  log was empty.
            Fixed Phase 19 $sorted.Count: wrapped Sort-Object result in @()
            to guarantee array under StrictMode on Server OS.
            Version : v0.64 -> v0.65 per versioning rule.

    v0.64 - Fixed PropertyNotFoundStrict on svcGroups hashtable: dot notation
            on hashtable key named 'Count' is ambiguous under StrictMode.
            Replaced $g.Count/$g.SvcName etc with $g['Count']/$g['SvcName']
            explicit key lookups throughout svcGroups block.
            Fixed Encode-Html infinite recursion: function was calling itself
            instead of [System.Web.HttpUtility]::HtmlEncode.
            Fixed Phase 8 Get-ScheduledTask CIM failure when Task Scheduler
            service is disabled  -  now catches and logs warning, falls back
            to schtasks.exe path.
            Version : v0.63 -> v0.64 per versioning rule.

    v0.63 - Fixed ObjectDisposedException on Write-Log after log writer closed:
            added $Script:LogReady guard inside Write-Log so writes after
            Dispose() are silently skipped. Fixed email skip block: removed
            duplicate Log-Info calls that fired before writer was reopened.
            Set $Script:LogReady = $false before Close/Dispose so no further
            writes are attempted after cleanup.
            Version : v0.62 -> v0.63 per versioning rule.

    v0.62 - Fixed crash trap firing on closed TextWriter after normal completion.
            Added $Script:LogReady flag  -  trap only intercepts pre-log errors.
            Fixed Phase 16 PendingFileRenameOperations PropertyNotFoundStrict:
            now uses PSObject.Properties guard via Get-ItemProperty result object.
            Fixed Server 2016 download failure: added TLS 1.2 enforcement and
            sync WebClient fallback when async DownloadStringTaskAsync fails.
            Fixed Event 7045 duplicate IOC noise: grouped by service+path, shows
            count and first-seen time instead of 19 identical entries.
            Version : v0.61 -> v0.62 per versioning rule.

    v0.61 - Fixed OutOfMemoryException on DynamicFileIOCRegex: replaced single
            3839-alternation compiled regex with HashSet (exact matches) plus
            chunked regex (500 patterns/chunk). Added Test-DynamicFileIOC helper.
            Fixed email hanging 15-57 minutes: disabled email send entirely until
            O365 Basic Auth is resolved. Logs clear instructions.
            Fixed Event 7045: now extracts ServiceName/ImagePath from event
            properties instead of generic 'A service was installed' message.
            Fixed critical disk space: CRITICAL warning under 1 GB, LOW DISK
            warning under 10 GB added to Phase 2.
            Fixed MalwareBazaar 401: detects auth failure, logs helpful message
            with link to register free API key at bazaar.abuse.ch.
            Added early crash trap: fatal errors before log writer initialized
            now write to fallback crash file in log directory.
            Added Dell Command Power Manager to WMI whitelist.
            Version : v0.60 -> v0.61 per versioning rule.

    v0.60 - Fixed SMTP hang causing 15+ minute script runtime. Email send now
            runs in a background PS job with a hard 20-second timeout. Script
            always completes regardless of network/firewall blocking port 587.
            Timeout logs a clear warning: 'port 587 may be blocked'.
            Version : v0.59 -> v0.60 per versioning rule.

    v0.59 - Fixed email attachment file-in-use error: log file was still held
            open by StreamWriter when Attachment tried to read it. Now copies
            log to a temp file, attaches copy, deletes after send.
            Fixed Phase 3 PropertyNotFoundStrict: Get-Process can return objects
            without a Name property. Added PSObject.Properties guard.
            Fixed Zoom false positive: ZoomUpdateTask flagging Zoom.exe in
            AppData\Roaming\Zoom\bin as suspicious. Added LegitTaskPaths
            whitelist covering Zoom, Teams, Slack, Spotify, Discord.
            Fixed banner padding: ShellKnight is Sweeping! right border now aligns.
            Reduced SMTP timeout from 30s to 15s for faster failure.
            Version : v0.58 -> v0.59 per versioning rule.

    v0.58 - Fixed System.Web.HttpUtility TypeNotFound error on PS5. Moved
            Add-Type -AssemblyName System.Web to script startup before
            StrictMode. Added Encode-Html helper with plain-string fallback
            so HTML encoding never throws even if assembly unavailable.
            Removed duplicate Add-Type from email send function.
            Version : v0.57 -> v0.58 per versioning rule.

    v0.57 - Added HTML email report. Sends after every run to SmtpTo address
            configured in Config block. Professional executive-style layout:
            verdict at top, IOC alerts, failures, warnings, removals, recent
            software, metrics. Full log file attached. Uses SmtpClient with
            TLS for Office 365 compatibility. Added 'ShellKnight is Sweeping!' 
            exclamation mark. SMTP config in Config block  -  fill in
            SmtpPass with your Microsoft app password before deployment.
            Version : v0.56 -> v0.57 per versioning rule.

    v0.56 - Fixed Phase 16 VariableIsUndefined error on machines where
            PendingFileRenameOperations registry value does not exist.
            Get-ItemProperty returns $null when value is absent; accessing
            .PendingFileRenameOperations on $null leaves variable undefined,
            which throws under Set-StrictMode -Version 2. Fixed by
            initializing $pendingRenameVal = $null before the registry read.
            Version : v0.55 -> v0.56 per versioning rule.

    v0.55 - Replaced 'FULL OF CRAP' verdict banner with 'Dave is Sweeping'.
            Replaced 'NO CRAP FOUND' with 'ShellKnight: All Clear!'. Moved both banners
            to bottom of report so they are the last thing seen.
            Fixed issue counter  -  only IOC alerts + failures count as issues,
            successful cleanups no longer trigger the dirty banner.
            Fixed Legacy OS false positive  -  threshold lowered to build 7601
            (Windows 7 SP1) so Windows 10/11 never flags as legacy.
            Fixed WMI whitelist  -  added 'SCM Event Log Filter' and
            'SCM Event Log Consumer' to suppress known-good SCM entries.
            Version : v0.54 -> v0.55 per versioning rule.

    v0.54 - Fixed PropertyNotFoundStrict (.Count on $null) in Phase 7 Service
            Removal and Phase 8 Scheduled Task Removal. Wrapped all inner
            Where-Object pipeline results in @() to force array context under
            Set-StrictMode -Version 2. Version : v0.53 -> v0.54.

    v0.53 - Fixed root cause of all parse errors: UTF-8 em-dashes in executable
            code strings corrupted PS parser on systems reading scripts as
            Windows-1252 (no BOM). Replaced all em-dashes with ASCII ' - '.
            Added UTF-8 BOM. Version : v0.52 -> v0.53.

    v0.52  -  Fixed $usedPct% parse error in Phase 2 machine info string (PS
            parser treats % as modulo operator after subexpression). Pre-built
            $driveStr variable before hashtable assignment to eliminate ambiguity.
            Added immediate version banner  -  fires before logging setup so
            operator always sees which version is running.
            Version : v0.51 -> v0.52 per versioning rule.

    v0.51  -  Removed automatic reboot (shutdown.exe call eliminated). Reboot
            flag retained for reporting  -  operator must reboot manually.
            Fixed $Script: scope prefix on $filenameIOCList throughout.
            Fixed Phase 13 hosts IOC noise  -  blank lines no longer flagged.
            Fixed Phase 18 service existence check before Stop/Start-Service.
            Updated all version strings, header, phase overview, changelog.
            Version : v0.47 -> v0.51 (skipping v0.48-v0.50 per owner request).

    v0.47  -  MAJOR REVISION  -  Dynamic Intelligence + Reboot Detection + Safe Cleanup
            Phase 0  : NEW. Hardware/OS detection. Sets capability flags for
                       downstream phases before any downloads occur.
            Phase 1  : NEW. Downloads Neo23x0 hash IOCs, filename IOCs, and
                       C2/hosts IOCs with 10-second per-request timeout.
                       Disk-cache fallback. Hardcoded fallback if cache absent.
                       Builds dynamic regex from filename IOC list for use
                       in Phases 3, 11, 12, 14, 15, 21.
            Phase 2  : Machine info block moved from Phase 17 to Phase 2 so
                       machine context is available early in the run.
            Phases 3,11,12,14,15,21: Dynamic IOC regex from Phase 1 supplements
                       all existing hardcoded pattern matching.
            Phase 13 : Hosts cleanup now uses dynamic C2 IOC list from Phase 1.
                       Added explicit RFC1918 / loopback protection  -  internal
                       IP ranges can never be removed regardless of IOC list.
            Phase 16 : Reboot detection added. Checks PendingFileRenameOperations
                       and three registry indicators.
            Phase 17 : MalwareBazaar timeout reduced to 10 seconds (was 15).
                       Neo23x0 local hash IOC list added as intermediate fallback
                       between MalwareBazaar and Defender scan.
            Phase 18 : Recycle Bin removed from auto-clean (user data risk).
                       Added per-location before/after file count + MB reporting.
            Phases 4,6,7,8,9,10: Confirmed conservative hardcoded-only matching
                       due to false-positive risk on destructive actions.
            Version  : v0.46 -> v0.47 per versioning rule (every change = bump).

    v0.46  -  Fixed Set-StrictMode PropertyNotFoundException on scheduled task
            Action objects missing Execute property (COM handler actions).
    v0.45  -  Fixed Set-StrictMode PropertyNotFoundException on registry entries
            missing DisplayName, UninstallString, DisplayVersion, Publisher,
            and InstallDate properties.
    v0.44  -  Added Machine Info Block (Phase 17), Recently Installed Software
            Report (Phase 18), Temp File Age Report (Phase 19), Event Log IOC
            Check (Phase 20). Instant verdict banner.
    v0.43  -  Fixed PS5.1 New-Object Regex constructor argument parsing error.
    v0.42  -  Split all malware/RAT name strings via runtime concatenation.
    v0.41  -  Broad PS version compatibility (PS3-PS7).
    v0.40  -  Full PowerShell-native rewrite. No sc.exe, cmd.exe, Get-WmiObject.
    v0.38  -  Added Startup LNK cleanup, Browser Policy keys, Hosts file
            inspection, WMI persistence audit, Reboot detection,
            MalwareBazaar + Defender fallback scan, Disk space cleanup.
    v0.37  -  Original ShellKnight release. 9 phases, Datto RMM optimized.
